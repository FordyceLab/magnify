    Find buttons in minichip images and standardize the resulting data in an xarray.Dataset

    Parameters
    ----------
    data :
        The input image data to be processed. It can be one of the following:
        - A file path or glob to image data.
        - An `xarray.DataArray` or `xarray.Dataset` containing image data.
        - A sequence of file paths, `xarray.DataArray`, or `xarray.Dataset`.
    shape :
        The shape of the button array, specifying the number of rows and columns in the image grid.
    pinlist :
        A file path to a CSV file that describes the tag to be assigned to each chamber on the chip. The CSV file must include
        a column called `Indices` that contains row and column pairs in the format `(row, col)`, and a
        `MutantID` column that contains the names of the buttons. Either `pinlist` or `shape` must be provided.
    blank :
        Values representing "blank" or non-expressed buttons in the pinlist, which will be replaced
        with empty strings in the dataset. Defaults to `["", "blank", "BLANK"]`.
    overlap :
        The number of pixels to exclude from the edges of adjacent tiles during the stitching process.
    rotation :
        The degree of rotation to apply to the stitched image.
    row_dist, col_dist :
        The distance between rows/columns of buttons in pixels.
    chip_type :
        The type of microfluidic chip that was imaged. Can be one of ["minichip"|"pc"|"ps"], if `chip_type` is not None then it will override `row_dist` and `col_dist`.
    min_button_diameter, max_button_diameter :
        The minimum/maximum diameter in pixels for detecting buttons in the image.
    chamber_diameter :
        The diameter in pixels of the chamber around each button.
    top_chamber, left_chamber :
        The pixel offset of the edge of the top/leftmost chamber on the chip. If set to `None` the offset is automatically found.
    low_edge_quantile, high_edge_quantile :
        The lower/upper quantile for edge detection, used to identify the dimmest edges when detecting buttons. Must be between 0 and 1.
    num_iter :
        The maximum number of iterations to perform the button detection process using RANSAC. A higher value will take longer but will find buttons more accurately.
    min_roundness :
        The minimum roundness value for detected buttons. Buttons that do not meet this roundness threshold are excluded. Must be between 0 and 1.
    cluster_penalty :
        A penalty number that balances two factors when identifying clusters: penalizing high inter-cluster variance and
        penalizing deviations from the expected number of items in a cluster. A higher value places more emphasis on the second factor
    roi_length :
        The length in pixels of the region of interest (ROI) around detected buttons. If None, the ROI length is set to 1.2 * `chamber_diameter`.
    progress_bar :
        If True, display a progress bar during processing to track the progress of the pipeline.
    search_timestep :
        The timesteps on which to search for buttons. A timestep that isn't in search_timestep will use the same button locations
        as the closest searched timestep before it, or if there isn't one the closest timestep after it.
    search_channel :
        The channel or list of channels to use for button detection and expression filtering. If `None`, all channels will be used.
    roi_only :
        If True, only returns the region of interest from the dataset.
    drop_tiles :
        If True, removes the "tile" variable from the dataset after stitching.
    interactive:
        If True, open a window to visualize and tune image processing step-by-step.

    Returns
    -------
    Processed image(s): xr.Dataset | list[xr.Dataset]
        The processed image in xr.Dataset from executed pipeline as the outcome of the image pipeline workflow.

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses a pipeline architecture to process image data. The steps in the pipeline consist of:

    - 'read' : Reads in an input set of zarr, tiff, ome-tiff, or xarray and associated metadata.
    - 'standardize_format' : Transforms the dataset into a consistent format for downstream processing.
    - 'identify_buttons' : Identifies buttons based on the provided `pinlist` or `shape` parameters.
    - 'stitch' : Stitches image tiles based on the overlap parameter.
    - 'find_buttons' : Detects buttons based on edge detection and clustering.
    - 'drop' : Optionally removes elements in the dataset based on the `roi_only`, and `drop_tiles` options.
    - 'restore_format' : Transforms the dataset back into the original format it was read in as.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> processed_mini_chip = mini_chip(
    ...     data=my_image_data, channels=[0], pinlist="pinlist.csv", overlap=100, rotation=45
    ... )

    This processes `my_image_data` by stitching tiles with 100 pixels of overlap, rotating the image by 45 degrees, using channel 0 for detection, and using the chamber layout from 'pinlist.csv'.

    Read in images and standardize the resulting data in an xarray.Dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data :
        The input image data to be processed. It can be one of the following:
        - A file path or glob to image data.
        - An `xarray.DataArray` or `xarray.Dataset` containing image data.
        - A sequence of file paths, `xarray.DataArray`, or `xarray.Dataset`.
    overlap :
        The number of pixels to exclude from the edges of adjacent tiles during the stitching process.
    roi_only :
        If True, only returns the region of interest from the dataset.
    drop_tiles :
        If True, removes the "tile" variable from the dataset after stitching.
    Returns
    -------
    Processed image(s) :
        The processed images and ROI.

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses a pipeline architecture to process image data. The steps in the pipeline include:

    - 'read' : Reads in an input set of zarr, tiff, ome-tiff, or xarray and associated metadata.
    - 'standardize_format' : Transforms the dataset into a consistent format for downstream processing.
    - 'stitch' : Stitches image tiles based on the overlap parameter.
    - 'drop' : Optionally removes elements in the dataset based on the `roi_only`, and `drop_tiles` options.
    - 'restore_format' : Transforms the dataset back into the original format it was read in as.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> processed_image = image(data=my_image_data, channels=[0, 1], overlap=100, rotation=45)
